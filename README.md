# CreatingARepo
Creating a repository
## The code I've learned in the past two weeks in R

R is a powerful programming tool used for statistical modelling and analysis.
### R is:
* Open source
* Powerful graphics
* Highly active community which keeps contributing to make coding in R easier.

## Week 1

### Basic math functions:

| Code     | Function|
|:---------|:--------|
| +        | Addition|
| -        | Substraction|
| *        | Multiplication|
| /        | Division|

## R - Cheatsheet
Since R has a very engaging community, you can find many contributions on the website which make programming with R a little easier. For example:

* [R-cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
* [The ultimate guide](https://youtu.be/b7AyKMhHl2Y)

## Creating a function with R
```
function1 <- function(arg1, arg2){
    input <- variable
    return (arg1, arg2
}

```
## More important functions
```
#For creating a vector
vector1 <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1-)
print(vector1)

# The sum function
sum(a)
# The length function
length(a)
# For the arithmetic mean
mean(a)
```

## The concepts I learned
| Function        | Call       |
|:----------------|:-----------|
|Create a vector  | c()        |
|Check the names  | names()    |
|Sort by value    | sort()     |
|arithmetic mean  | mean()     |
|Standard dev     | sd()       |
|Library install  | install.packages()|
|Make to a factor | as.factor()|
|Return the func  | return()|
|Round to the nearest value | round()|
|Square root      | sqrt()     |
|Random dist      | runif(n, min, max|

## Logical operators
| Sign           | Function    |
|:--------------:|:-----------:|
| >              | Greater than|
| <              | Less than   |
| ==             | Equal to    |
| |              | Or          |
| =<             | Less/Equal  |
| >=             | Greater/eql |
| %in%           | Within      |
| !=             | Not equal   |

# Week 2

## Creating a Github repository:

## Github, in plebian terms, is a place where developers and researchers share their code thereby streamlining information and making science and code more accessible

### Familiarising myself with Git commands
* Main : It is the main brance in your repository. It is where you put your polished and refined code.
* Branch : Branch is where you experiment on the code, Brance allows you a leeway to omit changes in case things turn nasty (very, very useful)
* Fork : Fork lets you to download and play with someone else's code (by making a copy on your computer) without changing the contents of the original code.
* Pull : When you want to update your repository with some desired changes, you initiate the pull command
* Push : push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.

# Final word
So in the past week I've (re)learned to use R more proficiently, making updates on GITHUB and prettyfying the tasks that were given. And I suppose that's it!
