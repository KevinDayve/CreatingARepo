## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##What I learned in Week 2 of the bioinformatics sesh.

```{r}
myvec <- ("Hey, I can now embed R code in a HTML document! ")
print(myvec)
```
#Moreover I created my first (well, technically second) repository on Github!

```{r}
#This is what I was perusing into this past week(well, obviously more than what youre about to see but here is a superficial dipping of the feet. Need me statistical prowess to return asap!!#

pacman::p_load(pacman, dplyr, GGally, ggplot2, ggthemes, ggvis, rmarkdown, shiny, lubridiate, stringr, tidyr, httr, rio)
library(datasets)

#Plotting the head of one of the oldest available dataset in R i.e Iris

head(iris)
```
```{r}
#One more plot :)
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width,
     col = "#FF0000",
     pch = 20,
     main = "Petal length vs Petal Width",
     xlab = "Petal length",
     ylab = "Petal width")
```
# Formatted
## text
*in*
**R Markdown**

```{r echo = FALSE}
hist(iris[[2]])
```
I also learnt about adding Inline code!
two plus two equals `r 2+2`
